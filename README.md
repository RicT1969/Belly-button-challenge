# Belly-button-challenge
An interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset. It links to an external site, and catalogues the microbes that colonise human navels.

The dataset reveals that a small handful of microbial species (also called operational taxonomic units, or OTUs, in the study) were present in more than 70% of people, while the rest were relatively rare. This is displayed through 3 interactive charts which are displayed on a (local) webpage using JavaScript. The html file (including css) were provided withint he starter code). The displays are driven by a drop down menu allowing the selection of a subject id (from 153 subjects) and include:<ol>
  <li>a barchart of the top ten bacteria by number found in each subject's navel;</li>
  <li>a panel with the demographic information about the subject (including id, gender, age etc,);</li>
  <li>a bubble chart showing all bacterial specimens per subject by size of population</li>
